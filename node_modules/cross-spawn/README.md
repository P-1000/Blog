A cross platform solution to node's spawn and spawnSync.


## Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD:Server/node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md
`$ npm install cross-spawn`

If you are using `spawnSync` on node 0.10 or older, you will also need to install `spawn-sync`:

`$ npm install spawn-sync`

=======
Node.js version 8 and up:
`$ npm install cross-spawn`

Node.js version 7 and under:
`$ npm install cross-spawn@6`
>>>>>>> f9995583c8ef31855f0b70ea32565e4b2299a09f:node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md

## Why

Node has issues when using spawn on Windows:

- It ignores [PATHEXT](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318)
<<<<<<< HEAD:Server/node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md
- It does not support [shebangs](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang)
- No `options.shell` support on node < v6
- It does not allow you to run `del` or `dir`
=======
- It does not support [shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))
- Has problems running commands with [spaces](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7367)
- Has problems running commands with posix relative paths (e.g.: `./my-folder/my-executable`)
- Has an [issue](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/issues/82) with command shims (files in `node_modules/.bin/`), where arguments with quotes and parenthesis would result in [invalid syntax error](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/e77b8f22a416db46b6196767bcd35601d7e11d54/test/index.test.js#L149)
- No `options.shell` support on node `<v4.8`
>>>>>>> f9995583c8ef31855f0b70ea32565e4b2299a09f:node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md

All these issues are handled correctly by `cross-spawn`.
There are some known modules, such as [win-spawn](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn), that try to solve this but they are either broken or provide faulty escaping of shell arguments.


## Usage

Exactly the same way as node's [`spawn`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`spawnSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options), so it's a drop in replacement.


```js
<<<<<<< HEAD:Server/node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md
var spawn = require('cross-spawn');

// Spawn NPM asynchronously
var child = spawn('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Spawn NPM synchronously
var results = spawn.sync('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
=======
const spawn = require('cross-spawn');

// Spawn NPM asynchronously
const child = spawn('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Spawn NPM synchronously
const result = spawn.sync('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });

```


## Caveats

<<<<<<< HEAD:Server/node_modules/cross-spawn/README.md
#### `options.shell` as an alternative to `cross-spawn`

Starting from node v6, `spawn` has a `shell` option that allows you run commands from within a shell. This new option solves most of the problems that `cross-spawn` attempts to solve, but:

- It's not supported in node < v6
- It has no support for shebangs on Windows
- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input

If you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.


#### Shebangs

While `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited: e.g.: it doesn't handle arguments after the path, e.g.: `#!/bin/bash -e`.
=======
### Using `options.shell` as an alternative to `cross-spawn`

Starting from node `v4.8`, `spawn` has a `shell` option that allows you run commands from within a shell. This new option solves
the [PATHEXT](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318) issue but:

- It's not supported in node `<v4.8`
- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input
- There are a lot of other unresolved issues from the [Why](#why) section that you must take into account

If you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.

### `options.shell` support

While `cross-spawn` adds support for `options.shell` in node `<v4.8`, all of its enhancements are disabled.

This mimics the Node.js behavior. More specifically, the command and its arguments will not be automatically escaped nor shebang support will be offered. This is by design because if you are using `options.shell` you are probably targeting a specific platform anyway and you don't want things to get into your way.

### Shebangs support

While `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited. More specifically, it just supports `#!/usr/bin/env <program>` where `<program>` must not contain any arguments.   
If you would like to have the shebang support improved, feel free to contribute via a pull-request.

Remember to always test your code on Windows!
